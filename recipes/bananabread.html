<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with 
    loads of banana flavor. Why compromise the banana flavor? 
    Friends and family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! 
    It tastes wonderful toasted. Enjoy! 
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure</li>
    <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it 
        helps the banana bread rise</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make 
        the loaf taste salty.</li>
    <li>A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor</li>
    <li>Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
    <li>Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
    <li>Bananas: Overripe</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
    <li>Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl. Add the eggs and 
        mashed bananas.</li>
    <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
</ol>
