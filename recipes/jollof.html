<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This traditional Nigerian dish brings out the best possible flavor 
    of rice and chicken. Chicken is first sauteed on the stove top to 
    produce a wonderful aromatic base for the rice. For an extra special 
    and authentic touch, serve jollof rice with fried plantains.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds chicken drumsticks</li>
    <li>1/2 large onion</li>
    <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 cubes chicken bouillon</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. 
        Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry 
        powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne 
        pepper. Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the 
        bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot,
        and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove f
        rom heat. </li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. 
        Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 
        1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids. </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in 
        the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An 
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part 
        should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low
        heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not 
        browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until 
        slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
    <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de 
        Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add 
        rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 
        20 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until 
        rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. 
        Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, 
        about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish 
        jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken. </li>
